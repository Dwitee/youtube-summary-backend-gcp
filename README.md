# ReMindmap Backend (GCP)

This repository contains the backend for the **ReMindMap** application, a tool designed to make video and audio media more accessible, especially for users with communication and comprehension difficulties such as aphasia.

The backend is powered by Flask and runs on a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) VM using Gunicorn for production deployment. It integrates Whisper, T5, Zephyr/Gemini, and LLaMA.cpp models for transcription, summarization, and mind map generation.

---

## Features

- Accepts uploaded video/audio files or YouTube URLs (first 7 minutes).
- Uses ASR models (Whisper) to transcribe speech.
- Summarizes video/audio content into timestamped chapters.
- Generates a structured, interactive mind map with narration and emojis.
- Text-to-speech support with controllable speed (0.25x, 0.5x, 1x).
- Stores metadata and generated outputs in Redis.
- Uploads and retrieves files from Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
- Cloud Logging for monitoring API performance and debugging.

##  Deployment

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Redis (local or cloud)
- GCP service account with access to Cloud Storage and Vertex AI (optional)
